	<h1> BIO </h1>
	<p> My name is Mary Kate and I am a rising junior at Tufts University. I am majoring in Engineering Psychology and (hopefully) minoring in both Computer Science and Music. I’m very interested in exploring the intersection that exists between STEM and the arts, hence my decision to minor in both music and CS! </p>
	<br/>
	<p> I was born in Connecticut but moved to Columbus, Ohio when I was 2 years old. I’ve lived in Columbus ever since and have grown super fond of the city. I also grew up with three older siblings (two sisters, one brother) and have had pet dogs almost my entire life. </p>
	<br/>
	<p> In my free time I like to play cello, hang out in Carm, go to the movies, or watch TV. This summer, I’ve been binge watching Westworld and Silicon Valley with the occasional episode of That 70s Show thrown in there. I’m almost caught up with both series, so if you have any TV recommendations, let me know! </p>
