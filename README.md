COMP20 - Ming 
Lab 4 - README

IMPLEMENTATION: I believe I implemented everything correctly. I still don't have a very good grasp of how to use git/github so if anything I may have some issues with commit messages and uploading the different files.

CREDITS TO: I did not work with anyone else to complete this project, however I did use many of the websites listed on the Week 2 page and w3schools.com for reference.

TIME TO COMPLETE: This assignment took me about 3 hours to complete.
